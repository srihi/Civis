# Civis
The project is named Civis, means Civilian in Latin. The app helps with engaging its users, it helps people seek for some help or offer a hand from/to people nearby. People can offer/request a service via the app, be it heavy lifting(move heavy objects), buy groceries, walk dogs or something as nice as request for meet up to talk with a stranger and what not.

## Instructions to run

In order to authenticate, if your phone have set default application to handle http://.... url, please reset it. The phone should ask you with which application you want to open this after authentication. This is because the current client of digitaltown doesn't allow us to use custom scheme beside http:// & https://. I have received mail that this will be updated in following days, but until then we're stuck with this option.
